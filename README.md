# A/B Test Analysis: Which Group Performs Better, Control or Test?

An A/B test aggregated data, from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergylog/ab-test-aggregated-data/data), is used to analyze which variant/group performs better in an A/B experiment.

Take a look at the jupyter notebook [**ab_test_analysis.ipynb**](https://github.com/laballais/ab_test_analysis/blob/main/ab_test_analysis.ipynb) to see how the data was cleaned, processed, analyzed, and visualized using *R*.
